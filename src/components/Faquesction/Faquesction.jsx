                The cover letter format is the layout of your letter, or how it
                will look to the reader — everything from colors and graphic
                elements to its fonts, line spacing and margins. Our examples
                and templates are perfectly formatted for any use.

                Unless the job application specifically requests you not to send
                a cover letter, it’s good practice to send one. When written
                correctly, a good cover letter can be a strong companion to your
                resume, and be a critical factor in getting you a job interview.
                The best cover letters give you the chance to introduce yourself
                and your skills, explain why you’re a good fit for the job
                opportunity, and provide more depth and context on your
                achievements.
